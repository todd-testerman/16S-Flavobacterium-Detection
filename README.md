# 16S-Flavobacterium-Detection

1. The Qiime2 script provides the specific commands used along with any adjusted parameters. If a parameter is not mentioned, the default was used. This script functioned to denoise and quality screen the data, assign taxonomy to the sequences with the Silva database, and generate a feature table, taxonomy file, representative sequences file, and phylogenetic tree file. These were used as input when generating R visualizations.

2. The Rmarkdown document details the import of Qiime2 files into R and the pre-processing of these files with phyloseq. Phyloseq and ggplot2 were then used to generate the taxonmic barplots presented in this paper.
